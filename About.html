     <h><strong>Everything About sky Homes,</strong></h>
     <p>Sky Homes is a luxury, green real estate development company, headquartered in Boston, MA with offices in New York, NY and Chicago, IL, that develops undervalued residential buildings in urban cities where real estate is constrained.

        We look to build penthouses on the unused rooftops of existing properties and to acquire town homes and expand vertically, providing value to the building, its tenants, and the city.</div>
      <div id="pat2">  
      <p> At the core of our business is green development and vertical expansion.  
        
        Our focus on sustainable design and architecture not only differentiates our product from the market, but it provides both the company and home buyer with tax incentives, cost savings, and fast tracks the approval process of our developments.</p></div>
        
        <div id="pat3">Many buildings can be expanded vertically to help meet the demands of the current market. By developing vertically, we are adding the much needed inventory to cities that are low in supply.
        
        There is a lot of value left to mine in these cities and we'll be at the forefront of this new trend.</p></div>
